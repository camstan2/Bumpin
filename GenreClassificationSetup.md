# Genre Classification Setup Guide

## The Problem
Your app's genre classification system was not working properly because:

1. **AI Classification Not Working**: The `AIGenreClassificationService` was using a mock response instead of calling the actual OpenAI API
2. **Poor Fallback Classification**: When AI failed, it fell back to hash-based random assignment, causing songs like "Bang" by Trippie Redd to be incorrectly categorized as "Electronic"
3. **Limited Artist Database**: The fallback classification had a very small database of known artists

## The Solution
I've implemented a comprehensive fix with multiple layers of genre classification:

### 1. **Real OpenAI API Integration**
- Added proper OpenAI API calls using GPT-4o-mini (cost-efficient)
- Configured with proper error handling and fallbacks
- Uses environment variable for API key security

### 2. **Enhanced Artist Database**
- Added comprehensive database of 50+ hip-hop artists including Trippie Redd
- Added databases for Pop, R&B, Rock, and Electronic artists
- Pattern-based detection for artists with "Lil", "Young", "Big", etc.

### 3. **Improved Apple Music Genre Mapping**
- Enhanced mapping to catch more Apple Music genre variations
- Added support for subgenres like "trap", "drill", "grime" for hip-hop
- Better handling of edge cases

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Use OpenAI API (Recommended)
1. Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Set the environment variable in your app:
   ```swift
   // In your app's configuration or environment
   ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"
   ```

### Option 2: Use Enhanced Rule-Based Classification (No API Key Needed)
The system will automatically fall back to the enhanced rule-based classification if no API key is provided. This includes:
- Comprehensive artist database (Trippie Redd is now properly recognized as Hip-Hop)
- Pattern-based detection for unknown artists
- Better Apple Music genre mapping

## Testing the Fix

To test that the fix works:

1. **Log a song by Trippie Redd** (like "Bang")
2. **Check the console logs** - you should see:
   ```
   ðŸŽ¯ Genre classified by artist database: Trippie Redd â†’ Hip-Hop
   ```
3. **Verify the genre** appears correctly in your profile's genre distribution

## Cost Considerations

- **OpenAI API**: ~$0.001-0.002 per song classification (very cheap)
- **Rule-based fallback**: Free, but less accurate for edge cases
- **Caching**: Results are cached to avoid re-classifying the same songs

## Monitoring

The system logs detailed information about classification methods:
- `ðŸŽ¯ AI classified`: OpenAI API was used
- `ðŸŽ¯ Genre classified by artist database`: Artist was found in our database
- `ðŸŽ¯ Genre classified by fallback`: Hash-based fallback was used

## Next Steps

1. **Set up the OpenAI API key** for best accuracy
2. **Test with various artists** to ensure proper classification
3. **Monitor the logs** to see which classification method is being used
4. **Consider adding more artists** to the database as needed

The system is now much more accurate and should properly classify "Bang" by Trippie Redd as Hip-Hop instead of Electronic!
