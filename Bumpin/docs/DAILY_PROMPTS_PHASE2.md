# Daily Prompts Phase 2: Backend Services & Logic ✅

## Phase 2 Complete: Backend Services & Logic

Phase 2 implementation is now complete! We've built a comprehensive backend service layer that handles all business logic, real-time functionality, and data management for the Daily Prompts feature.

The backend is production-ready and follows all your app's existing patterns and conventions. All services are fully tested, documented, and optimized for performance and scalability.

### 🔧 Service Usage Examples

**Basic Usage:**
```swift
// Initialize coordinator (typically in app or main view)
@StateObject private var promptCoordinator = DailyPromptCoordinator()

// Check if user can respond
if promptCoordinator.canRespondToCurrentPrompt {
    // Show response UI
}

// Submit response
await promptCoordinator.submitResponse(
    songId: "123",
    songTitle: "Song Name",
    artistName: "Artist Name",
    explanation: "This song perfectly captures..."
)

// Toggle like on response
await promptCoordinator.toggleLikeResponse(response)

// Add comment
await promptCoordinator.addComment(
    to: response,
    text: "Great choice!"
)
```

**Admin Usage:**
```swift
// Create new prompt
await promptCoordinator.createPrompt(
    title: "Perfect rainy day song",
    description: "What matches the sound of raindrops?",
    category: .mood,
    activateImmediately: true
)

// Generate smart prompt
if let template = promptCoordinator.adminService.generateSmartPrompt() {
    await promptCoordinator.createPromptFromTemplate(template)
}
```

This completes Phase 2 of the Daily Prompts feature. The backend infrastructure is robust, scalable, and ready for UI integration!
