# Firebase Setup Instructions

## Current Issue
The project has Firebase SDK installed but the specific Firebase products need to be added to your app target.

## Quick Fix in Xcode

### 1. Add Firebase Products to Target
1. In Xcode, select your **Bumpin** project in the navigator
2. Select your **Bumpin** app target
3. Go to **General** tab
4. Scroll down to **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**
5. Click the **+** button
6. Add these Firebase products:
   - **FirebaseAuth**
   - **FirebaseCore** 
   - **FirebaseFirestore**
   - **FirebaseCrashlytics** (if you use crash reporting)
   - **FirebaseStorage** (if you use file storage)

### 2. Alternative Method (Package Dependencies)
1. Select your **Bumpin** project in navigator
2. Go to **Package Dependencies** tab
3. Find **firebase-ios-sdk** in the list
4. Make sure these products are checked for your target:
   - FirebaseAuth
   - FirebaseCore
   - FirebaseFirestore

### 3. Build and Test
1. Clean Build Folder (⇧⌘K)
2. Build project (⌘B)
3. Should now compile with zero errors!

## What I've Done
- Added conditional compilation (`#if canImport(...)`) to handle missing Firebase gracefully
- The app will work with mock data if Firebase packages aren't available
- Once you add the packages, it will use real Firebase functionality

## Expected Result
After adding the Firebase products to your target:
- ✅ Zero compilation errors
- ✅ Firebase functionality restored
- ✅ Friend profile pictures feature working
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

The conditional compilation ensures the app builds regardless of Firebase availability!
